# Compose YAML Rules

- Do NOT include the `version` field at the top level of the compose file. Omit it entirely to avoid warnings with recent Docker Compose versions.
- When defining service ports, only include ports in the `ports` section if they need to be accessible from outside the Compose network (e.g., for development, public APIs, or reverse proxies).
  Do NOT specify ports in the `ports` section solely for inter-container communication; rely on Docker's internal networking for service-to-service access.
- Use clear, descriptive service names and keep services modular and purpose-driven.
- Use named volumes for persistent data and define them at the bottom of the file for clarity.
- Leverage environment variables for configuration, preferably via `.env` files, to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
- Define custom networks explicitly if you need to control service isolation or communication.
- Add concise comments to explain non-obvious configuration choices.
