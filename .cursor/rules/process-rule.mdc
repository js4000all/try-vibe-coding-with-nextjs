# Process Rules

- Limit the scope of each implementation task as much as possible; implement only one small feature or change at a time[1][5].
- Alternate between implementation phases and refactoring phases.
- During implementation phases:
  - Prioritize getting things working over abstraction or unification with existing code.
  - Do not focus on code reuse or generalization at this stage.
  - Always write appropriate tests for any new code.
- During refactoring phases:
  - Focus exclusively on improving code structure, readability, and maintainability.
  - Do not add new features or change existing functionality.
- After completing each phase (implementation or refactoring), always create a commit to record the changes.
- Prefer end-to-end tests for user-facing features, but include unit tests as needed[1].
- Avoid accumulating large, unreviewed changes; keep iterations small and frequent.
